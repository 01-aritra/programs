/*Write a C program that finds the maximum and minimum elements in an array of integers using pointers.
 The program should prompt the user to enter the size of the array and its elements, then it should compute
  and display the maximum and minimum elements in the array. Make sure to implement the functions for finding
   the maximum and minimum using pointers.*/
